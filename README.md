# Grocery-Item-Tracker-
Grocery Item Tracker 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project I analyzed text records and produced three lists. The first list generates a list of all items purchased in each day along with the number of times each item was purchased. the second list generates a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in each day. Finally, the last list generates text-based histogram listing all items purchased in each day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. The aim for this project was to compress and translate information into a readable format in order to see trends in customer purchasing patterns to increase profit for the store. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I created the python functions to generate all three lists in and readable fashion. I believe that I documented each line of code very well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could do more to make my code a little but more reusable and secure. At this point in my education, I don’t know much about secure coding, but I tried to implement all that I knew to code this project.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn’t find any piece of code for this project particularly hard to write. Most of my issues came with navigating Visual Studios which I over came by starting a new project. I tried using outside resources such as stack overflow and YouTube to no avail for this issue. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Particular skills in this project that will be transferable for future projects and course work is working in two different languages using one IDE. Many apps, websites, and games, implement multiple languages. Learning how to do it is extremely useful for future projects. Another skill that I found to be transferable was opening, reading, and creating new txt documents. This skill is transferable because it allows me to access a wider range of information, like from websites, that I sometimes see other programs do. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, by creating comments to note what each function is doing. This program can also be used to read a lot of other text documents that contain duplicate items and condense them into a readable format.
